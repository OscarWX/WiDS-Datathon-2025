# WiDS-Datathon-2025
This project anlyzes We will analyze diagnostic data, socio-demographic, emotions, and parenting data, and functional MRI data from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) â€” the signature scientific initiative of the Child Mind Institute.

This is the ongoing project that I am working on.
Unfortunately MRI data is too large to be uploaded here, so I am current working on it with google colab.
